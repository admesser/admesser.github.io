        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>I have worked on projects using Wordpress, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I learned some html back in the early 2000s, using it for Geocities, but have not used it in a while. I am interested in working on projects that I can learn and contribute, that help the community.</p>

        <h3>Project #1 The Savannah Quill</h3>
        <p>Project #1 The Savannah Quill connects writers and readers to promote literacy. We are partnering with the Live Oak Public Libraries for our book convention. We host different community events to help raise awareness and literacy. I use Wordpress for the content management, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for social media management. www.savannahquill.com</p>

        <h3>Project #2 Let's Can Hunger</h3>
        <p>Project #2 Let's Can Hunger is a grass roots canned food, school supplies, clothes and toys drive to help those in need. I work with local businesses to collect donations. The most recent one was held November 5,2016 with the City of Bloomingdale. We raised hundreds of canned goods, and toys for a local food bank and giving tree. I used Facebook advertising tools to promote the event, and we had hundreds of people show up.</p>
